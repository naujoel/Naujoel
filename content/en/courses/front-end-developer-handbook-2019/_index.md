Written by Cody Lindley

Sponsored by Frontend Masters, advancing your skills with in-depth, modern front-end engineering courses

## Overview:

This is a guide that everyone can use to learn about the practice of front-end development. It broadly outlines and discusses the practice of front-end engineering: how to learn it and what tools are used when practicing it in 2019.

It is specifically written with the intention of being a professional resource for potential and currently practicing front-end developers to equip themselves with learning materials and development tools. Secondarily, it can be used by managers, CTOs, instructors, and head hunters to gain insights into the practice of front-end development.The content of the handbook favors web technologies (HTML, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript) and those solutions that are directly built on top of these open technologies. The materials referenced and discussed in the book are either best in class or the current offering to a problem.

The book should not be considered a comprehensive outline of all resources available to a front-end developer. The value of the book is tied up in a terse, focused, and timely curation of just enough categorical information so as not to overwhelm anyone on any one particular subject matter.

The intention is to release an update to the content yearly. This is currently the fourth year an edition has been released.

### What is in this Handbook:

Chapter 0 provides a lite recap of the year in front-end development and what may be to come. Chapter 1 & 2 aim to give a brief overview of the discipline and practice of front-end development. Chapters 3 & 4 organize and recommend learning paths and resources. Chapter 5 organizes and list the tools used by front-end developers and Chapter 6 highlights front-end information outlets.
