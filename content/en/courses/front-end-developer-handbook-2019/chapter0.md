## 0.1 — Recap of Front-end Development in 2018

- React had several notable releases this past year that included, lifecycle methods, context API, suspense, and React hooks.
Microsoft buys Github. Yeah, that happened.

- Fonts created by CSS became a thing.

- What I used to call front-end driven apps, gets labeled "serverless". Unfortunately, this term is overloaded. However, the term JAMstack does seem to be resonating with developers.

- Google offered some neat tools this year to help make webpages load faster, i.e. squoosh and quicklink.

- Vue gets more Github stars than React this year. But React remains dominant in terms of use.

- A solution similar to React, without a virtual DOM or JSX, is introduced RE:DOM.

- Alternatives to NW.js and Electron show up, DeskGap and Neutralino.js.In 2017 the great divide between a front-end HTML & CSS developer v.s. front-end application developer is realized/verbalized. In 2018 that divide has grown wider and deeper and more people start to feel the divide.

- This year, like most recent years, was stock full of app/framework solutions trying to contend with the mainstream JavaScript app tools (i.e. React, Angular, and Vue etc...) Let me list them for you. Radi.js, DisplayJS, Stimulus, Omi, Quasar.

- JavaScript frameworks start offering their own languages that compile to JavaScript (e.g. Mint).

- CodeSandbox evolves to become the dominant solution for online code sharing.

- CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox are fully supported in modern browsers and get taken for some serious rides. But many are left wondering when to use which one and how.

- Many realize the long terms costs of bolted on type systems (e.g. TypeScript and Flow). Some concluded bolted on systems are not unlike bolted on module systems (i.e. AMD/Require.js) and come with more issues than solutions. Minimally, many developers realize that if types are needed in large code bases, that bolted on systems are not ideal in comparison to languages that have them baked in (e.g. Reason, Purescript, Elm).

- CSS Variables gain browser support among modern web browsers

- The flavors of CSS in JS exploded and some question the practice.

- ES modules are now usable in modern browsers and dynamic imports are close behind. We are even seeing a shift in tooling around this fact.

- Many realize that end to end testing is the starting point of doing tests correctly in large part due to Cypress (i.e. Cypress first, then Jest).

- While Webpack was heavily used again this year, many developers found Parcel to be easier to get up and running.

- One of the most important questions asked this year was, what is the cost of JavaScript.

- Babel 7 was released this year. That's a big deal because the last major release was almost three years ago.The reality of too much JavaScript change too fast is realized and people start talking about what you need to know before you can even learn something like React. The fight is real.

- Most developers found GraphQL, via Apollo, and see it as the next evolution for data API's.

- Gulp and friends definitely took a back seat to NPM/Yarn run. But this did not stop Microsoft from getting in the game with Just.

- This year, one can not only lint/hint HTML, CSS, and JavaScript they can lint/hint the web itself.

- The 2018 Front-End Tooling survey is worth reading if only to realize just how much jQuery is still used.

- It can't be denied TypeScript gained a lot of users this year.

- VScode, dominates as the code editor of choice.

## 0.2 — In 2019, Expect...

- Hopefully, more of this to come. "Stepping away from Sass".

- Still a good idea to keep an eye on and learn about the up coming additions (and potential additions) to CSS via https://cssdb.org

- The WebP image format from Google could reach support from all modern browsers this year.

- Prepack will continue to cook.

- GraphQL will continue to gain massive adoption.

- The, "State of JavaScript" survey authors will add a "State of CSS" survey in 2019.

- Keep an eye on Web Animations API.

- Someone you know will try and convince you to use TypeScript.Babel will get some competition from swc-project.

- The case for, JAMStack's will continue.

- Chasing the one code base to many platforms will continue.

- More developers will turn to languages like ReasonML over JavaScript/TypeScript for large code bases.

- More, largely used projects will start to shed jQuery in favor of native DOM solutions.

- Web Components! At this point, I have no idea how Web Components will play out. Reality is they are not going away, and they have not gained a lot of momentum/usage once the hype ended.
