abstract: Pensions for permanent disability may be of a contributory or non-contributory nature, depending on whether the invalid would have contributed to Social Security for the period provided or not. The role of these benefits also varies in each case. While the contributory arm of the Social Security System is characterized by a marked professionalism note, which determines the purpose of the benefit, the non-contributory or universal arm guarantees a minimum of income to those who are in a situation of real need for absence income. Hence, the amount of the benefit depends on the type of benefit, the years quoted and the degree of disability recognized.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: The objective of this work is to try to give a secure legal response to the beneficiary of an IP benefit that is willing to work.
