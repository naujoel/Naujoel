Bad news !: nobody changes by reading a book, or going to the psychologist!
Good news !: but it can be achieved, surprisingly radical,
With a little daily effort.

Indeed, self transformation requires practice and effort.
But it's about the most important learning in one's life: the passport to
a much better life, much happier and fuller.

This book is a powerful personal transformation tool, a complete
autotherapy manual. It is based on cognitive psychology, behavioral and
third-generation mindfulness, the most scientific forms of therapy, more
contrasted with studies.

In my consultations in Barcelona and Madrid, we have been seeing thousands of
patients and we have a success rate of more than 80%. That is, 80% of the
People who come to see us reach their therapeutic goals. Y,
self-assessing at the end of therapy, they report an improvement in their world
emotional of at least an 8 out of 10. That is, they feel very happy and
satisfied with their life (where «0» is how they arrived at the consultation and «10», the
best possible state).

With the right guidance — like this book — we can all reach — and
overcome— those results.

Practical exercises are offered at the end of each part. Any of them serves
As a daily practice. We can perform them without a fixed order, according to the concern of the moment.
These exercises refer to the "neuros" typical of human beings:
working on those aspects will make us stronger people in the different
areas of life.

I suggest that the reader enjoy, at his own pace, each chapter and perform
one of the exercises daily (for at least twenty minutes). Without
doubt, you will see your emotional muscle grow: as in the gym, you will gain strength and
flexibility, power and energy!

As a personal fitness trainer would say: "Put the batteries on!" Here
start our best emotional way!
