The so-called Spanish civil war was thus baptized to make up the truth. That's what it was called during the dictatorship and that's what we keep calling it today.

What happened in Spain resembles a civil war as soon as there were two ideologies faced in the same country, and resembles a coup d'etat as it was a violent takeover of political power, however using the term "Civil war "It matches the legitimacy of the contestants and therefore, the winner of the contest is a legitimate winner. The result is an anomaly, **the violent usurper cannot go unpunished** due to a typing error.

In the Transition (from 1975 to 1979) many things had to be sacrificed in favor of stability. The clearest example was admitted [Don Adolfo Suárez in an interview with Victoria Prego](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxRYeI4dfr4), when he said he did not make a referendum on Monarchy or Republic because he knew he would win the Republic. And as I say, this was an intelligent decision in favor of political stability.

However, 40 years have passed since the return of democracy to Spain and the civil war is still called that when it should be called **coup d'etat perpetrated by the Army with the blessing of the Church and the help of German National Socialism (the Nazis ) that triggered a war for the maintenance of democracy**, the **referendum on Monarchy or Republic** is still pending and as if that were not enough **the Francoist torturers are decorated**, so it is not surprising Catalonia wants to become independent.

I do not share the justification that the independentistas use to achieve their objective, from the neutral bench we think that **the independence claim is based on vaporous arguments**, however, if I stop to visualize an independent, republican, without Francoist Catalonia, without decorated torturers, without the pageantry of the monarchy, without the pageantry of the Church, without kings, nor dukes, nor counts, nor marqueses, without revolving doors, ..., I believe that if that possibility came to me **I would be one of the that would pack and go to Catalonia**. I have no doubt that in a short time Catalonia would surpass Spain in many positive aspects, for the simple reason that by having the experience of everything that is done badly in Spain, I would try to avoid it and the result would obviously be better.

For all this, the Spanish people should start by facing the pending subjects. And in this process the independentistas should redirect their objective, because they spend a lot of energy on what is now a utopia, while if they invested that same energy in reaching a Spanish republic they would be working for a real objective that would place them closer to their ideals.

**Is the idea of ​​making a referendum on monarchy or republic a barbarity?**

No. The Spanish Constitution in its article 1.2 establishes that the sovereign of Spain is the Spanish People. And after all, a referendum only means knowing what the Spanish people think about the issue. If Monarchy won it would reinforce it and if it won the Republic there would be no need to be traumatic, but simply to prepare a smooth and safe process towards the Republic. And in any case, it would constitute an **act of democratic normality**.

**And is that I am a Republican or I want to break Spain?**

**Neither one nor the other.**

I am only a jurist, and as such, I observe conflicts and try to find solutions. In fact, I believe that Don Felipe de Borbón is a good Head of State, and in the hypothetical case that the Spanish People chose to become a Republic, he deserved to be the first Head of State of the Republic.

In my humble opinion, considering as "the pending subject" to all those acts that did justice with the last democratic period prior to the current one and condemned the coup plotters, the fact that the Spanish people do not face their pending subject endangers their own unity of Spain.

If there are no gestures in the right direction, such as eliminating the immatriculations of the Church, removing the decorations from the Francoists, stop calling the coup Civil War, prohibit the exaltation of the dictator, etc., while gestures are not made in this Sense positions in this country will be polarized and radicalized.

It is true that in the Transition one had to strive for stability, even at the time of Felipe González, but not today. Today we belong to the EU and to a globalized world and the arms uprising in Spain would have **little travel**.

For all this, and especially for the good of Spain, the Spanish people must be brave and claim the pending justice. If I did and faced with the pending subject, in Spain we would reach a _statu quo_ where **the idea of independence would lose meaning**, after all, we live in a globalized world where bridges are laid and walls are broken. The CoR (defense committees of the Republic), Catalan deputies, and independent leaders should be **consistent with history**, honor their predecessors, and fight for the best for the world, the best for Europe and the best for Spain, because that is to fight for the best for Catalonia, just as they did **President Companys or Pau Casals among many other illustrious Catalans**.
