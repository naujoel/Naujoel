It is a pity that between God and us the Church is involved, if God had a profile on Facebook the world would be a better world.

If we could communicate directly with God, the Church would not have any excuse to continue existing and could **retire the army** of clergy, priests, deacons, archbishops, bishops, cardinals, lawyers, canons, vicars, presbyters, secretaries, abbots, priors, nuns, friars, guards ... with a **lifetime pay** for each one, and there would still be enough to convert the entire African continent, from the third world to a world power.

And could I really do so much?

Let's see if we can answer this question.

Let's start at the beginning, what is that of "the Church"? When a layman is asked this question, he usually replies: "I don't know, it's like a stone, I think that **is useless**, but **has always been there**".

Regardless of whether or not it serves something, it is obvious that it is not as serene, nor as naive, nor as innocent, nor as innocuous as a stone, the Church influences, influences, exercises power, decides, ...

Ok, but then what is it? The Church is so big, so powerful, and it is so long between us that it can be described from **multitude of perspectives**, with the result of **multitude of definitions**, all correct.

Still, if we were to describe whatever the Church is in a single sentence, **in a tweet**, perhaps a good phrase would be "the Church is **the good cop of the world**".

The **technique of the good cop and the bad cop** is a method used at all levels of society **by those who have some power** and want to **submit or convince someone**. It is used by parents with children, police with criminals, bosses with employees, and conservative governments (in alliance with the Church) with citizens.

Since it was invented, 2000 years ago (this data is not strictly true but it does not matter), the Church has been managing and **having the faith** of the believers, maintaining a **neutral discourse** capable of allying with the ideology that suits him best.

Over the years, he realized that having the faith of the world was something important for governments, especially when, throughout history, he has been **seeing Emperors, Kings, Dictators kneeling,** Caudillos, Generals, Presidents, and other leaders of the executive branch, to request their **good cop services**.

And for so long it has been like this, that the Church has been charging itself with power again and again, more and more power, until it becomes an **immeasurable power**.

One knows that the Church is powerful when it sees that religious pedophiles evade Justice for reasons of prescription of crimes, since cases are known (more than 60 years ago), and that this prescription is still kept intact so that new cases of religious pedophiles can **continue to evade Justice**.

One knows that the Church is powerful when one sees that in a secular country a public road is articulated (the IRPF box) to **facilitate the flow of income**.

One knows that the Church is powerful when he sees that a young abbot refuses to appear in the Senate to explain his refusal to allow eight exhumations and refuses to serve court sentences while allowing masses for a dictator, and especially when he sees that All this is able to do it **with a smile and without disheveled**

One knows that the Church is powerful when he sees that in a secular country laws are made to measure so that he can incorporate public heritage into his patrimony through **registrations**.

One knows that the Church is powerful when he sees that there are still places of worship in Spain with plaques and symbols of **exaltation of the dictator** where **Francoist masses** are celebrated.

And we could continue with many more cases, but I think it is not necessary to extend further, **the power of the Church is obvious**.

Let us now return to the question at hand, that of whether the world would be a better world without the Church, that is, without the **political-institutional machinery** that constitutes the Church, and was again what it was in its beginnings , a religious movement that believes in a certain God and dispenses with intermediaries, that **Christian movement that arose in Roman times**.

If God had a profile on Facebook we could do without the intermediary to manage our faith and the Church could **dismantle the beach bar**, transform all its assets into money and distribute it to the best of its knowledge and understanding. That same day the world would cease to have **the expense of maintaining it**, which suddenly represents **an undoubted improvement**.

But also, with all the money obtained, I could help Africa. For most, Africa is a continent that is **somewhere**, which is **full of stinky blacks** who come to the countries of Europe **to steal our food**.

However, the truth is that Africa is a continent located in the south of Europe, of which all European countries have been **extracting wealth since forever**, which is full of **people who want the same thing** that Europeans want , to **live and survive in peace**, and to continue plundering diamonds, ivory, oil, wood, gold, etc., do not hesitate to devise **legal formulas**, generate **new wars**, etc, and above all, it seems that taking away the riches **do a favor to the Africans**.

Seen this way, if the Church disappeared it could become the **world bank of the poor**, it could do **infrastructure** in Africa, overthrow dictatorships and **establish democracies** in African countries, **cultivate to the population**, generate a **market economy** that gave companies confidence, bring companies to Africa that gave **work to the population**, etc ...

Of course ... then you could no longer call "stinky blacks" to Africans, ... although well ... **you will always have Twitter to say barbarities**.

Therefore, I think I can say that **if God had a profile on Facebook, the world would be a better world**.
