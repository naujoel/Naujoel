Labels help us think and facilitate communication, it is common to label politicians with names such as: Republicans, Democrats, Conservatives, Labor, Reds, Facades, Liberals, Progressist, Left, Right, etc. But do we really know its meaning? **Do we know what is behind each label**?

In politics there are some parameters that serve to draw the profile of each political group and help us to know which foot each limps. The problem is that, as **WhyDemocracy** says in the following videos, we are surrounded by mediocre politicians unable to define themselves, who could propose a program with coherent measures.

Failing that, in order to be aware of the profiles of the candidates in the next elections, I have prepared a list with those **parameters that draw the profiles of the political parties** so that we know what is behind the labels.

Apply the parameters to the political parties that are presented to the next elections to be able to cast an **informed and responsible vote**.

1. **Transigence**: willingness to reach agreements within the legal system
  * More willing to negotiate and reach agreements
  * Less willing to negotiate. Those who think that the world can only be the way they see it
2. **Tolerance**: willingness to respect who is not the same as you or does not think like you (ex. blacks and homosexuals)
  * More willing to respect others
  * Less willing to respect others
3. **Friendship**: tendency to favor friends to the detriment of strangers
  * They use more publicity in their processes
  * They use less publicity in their processes to benefit cronyism
4. **Prepotency**: feel with some power superior to others, of a different, superior race.
  * More consistent, simple and flat
  * They believe they belong to a select group and do not need more merits than that group membership
5. **Influential by icons and brands**
  * They are not influenced by icons and brands
  * Icons and brands are your guides. Anything that is wrapped with the flag of Spain deserves respect and anyone who wears a Ralph Lauren polo can gobern a country.
6. **Religiosity**: who have religious beliefs
  * More non-denominational, such as the Spanish Constitution
  * Less non-denominational, with a tendency towards the Catholic religion.
7. **They look to the future / they look to the past**
  * Look more to the future
  * Continue to look to the past
8. **The value of the legal system**
  * Everything must be within the Law
  * Almost everything must be within the Law
9. **Privatization of the public**
  * More tendency for everything that can be public
  * More tendency for everything that can be privatized
10. **More help to the citizen / more help to the employer**
  * More tendency to favor citizens
  * More tendency to favor entrepreneurs
11. **Honesty**: ability to act rightly, fulfilling the duty in accordance with ethics and morals
  * More need to be honest, until becoming a fundamental requirement of the politician
  * Less need to be honest
12. **Resilience**: ability to fight adversities
  * More ability to fight for goals
  * Less fighting ability. Those who come to politics because they have to eat something, but without suffering.
13. **Responsibility**: ability to self-incriminate an error
  * The guilty pays for his mistakes, and that includes me
  * The fault is always someone else's

To finish forming the conscience, it should be noted that there is another classification of political groups between anecdotal and basic. In order to separate from each other we use parameters related to the viability of their proposals.

They are **anecdotal** those political parties with extravagant or simply impossible proposals, such as: Vox, ERC, CUP, PACMA, etc.

While they are **basic** those political parties whose proposals conform to the legal system and the actuality in which we live, such as: PSOE, Podemos, PP, Ciudadanos, PNV, etc.

This whole galaxy of names and adjectives has always been reduced to a couple of labels, "Left" and "Right," but either we have been really clumsy in the election, or an effort is being made to hide the true profile. each. In any case, if we stubbornly label politicians, it might be better to use words that do not lead to confusion, non-existent words that do not convey additional information beyond the defining features, perhaps we could use words like "Vestranios" and "Onibios", or "Felastros" and "Ostropides". Perhaps this way we will be able to **separate the stereotypes** and pay more attention to what really interests us: **our future**.

With all this information, considering the consequences of the D'Hont system for the distribution of seats, we have the **obligation to cast a responsible vote** in the next elections.

Obviously, everything would be different if, as the videos of Whydemocracy say, we would change the representative mandate we grant to our politicians for an imperative mandate.

But is it necessary to change the entire system established to achieve greater control over what is done in Spain? **Would it be possible to establish an Assembly that represented and articulated the will of the People**?

Let's see if we can get anywhere on this.

Computing allows to articulate a national Assembly without making displacements. That Assembly could be made up of all citizens who wanted to be part of it. In turn, there could be groups of intellectuals who publish proposals related to their fields of knowledge. These proposals could be followed by the rest of the citizens, who could vote which should follow the approval procedure.

As soon as the Assembly had proposals that require approval, they could connect with the current procedures for approval of proposals, reaching the Courts like the rest of the proposals. If that Assembly existed, the proposals would be made by scientists, intellectuals, economists, ..., of this country, and not politicians, and citizens would have a more formed opinion about what to do and what not to do with our future.

It is possible to think that it did not have enough power to change things and that the proposals would remain halfway, but if we stop to visualize that Assembly, there is no doubt that, like all power, it would radiate some coercive power, the power of the People.

The People today have certain measures to indicate their will (ex. the vote) but also new coercive measures could be created that would force the Cortes to adopt their proposals, such as: strikes, demonstrations, boycotts, blockades, etc. Anyway, it is foreseeable that the sovereign of something does not need to be coercive to exercise his sovereignty because if it is coercive it is because someone is discussing the sovereignty and as long as that discussion is not resolved you cannot be sovereign. Consequently, if the People are sovereign, it will be because they do not need coercion.

Well, then it seems that it can be done.

Now comes the question about why, that is, should we do it? **Why should we create an online People's Assembly**?

Well, Whydemocracy's videos already give some reasons. The video of Michael Moore "**What we invade now**" gives us some idea that governments are not usually aware of what the people really want and adopt measures that are either simply electoral, or are directly sectarian. Michael Moore's late-night explorer pints should not mislead you. Despite his style, Michael Moore has done a great job touring the world in search of other ways of doing politics and the result is surprising. You can not miss this video.

The [Pachamama Alliance](https://www.pachamama.org/), an initiative that began in the 1990s to protect some South American ethnic groups and has spread throughout the world, teaches us that great things can be done if we join will, common sense and technological means. The video is in English, so I recommend that you also visit their website for more information.

And **Greta Thunberg**, a small, shy and survivor of a paralyzing depression, a 16-year-old Swedish woman who missed school to remind the world that the problem of climate change must be addressed, until she managed to attract the attention of The media has given us a lesson on what to do when we believe in something.

**At the domestic level**, it occurs to me that we could do it for Severo Ochoa, or Pau Casals, or Federico García Lorca, or Antonio Machado, for your grandparents, for my grandparents, for those who had to go into exile or for so many others. Severo Ochoa was an exiled scientist to the United States who won the Nobel Prize and who, despite the innumerable invitations he received from the Franco regime to return to his homeland with honors, remained faithful to his principles and far from Franco's tyranny. Pau Casals was and continues to be considered the best cellist of all time, lived in exile in Mexico where he created a world-renowned school, always wanted to return to his homeland and expected the death of the dictator to return, but did not succeed, dying in 1973. And finally, what am I going to tell you about Lorca, Machado or so many others.

Perhaps **we could do it for them**, for all those who fought to maintain democracy in the 30s of the last century, and today it is as if they had never existed:

- Why are there memories in Spain that extol the coup plotters who violated the constitutional order established in 1931?
- Why is there so much cowardice when it comes to putting everyone in their place?
- Why has the Spanish criminal order not yet been equated with German and Italian criminal orders with rules that declare the exaltation of the dictator a crime?
- Why not speak in Spain with fullness of the last democratic period before the current one?

And these are just some of the reasons, since we could continue with issues such as the rental price, the outstanding debt of the banks, the price of electricity, etc.

Anyway, in any case, **it is very important that in the next elections you cast an informed and responsible vote**.
