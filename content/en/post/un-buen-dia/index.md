The PP is a political party made up of a great majority of extraordinary people, but it also suffers from integrating a minority of upset Francoists who, at the slightest opportunity, try to **apply** the **methods learned** and **revive past times**.

My opinion is that Franco's weight on the back of "the right" will take its toll sooner rather than later and that it would be much more important to condemn the dictatorship and be consistent with democracy, I am referring to what should happen to everyone the children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of senior Franco positions to the eighth or ninth row of the political scene in order to blur their visibility.

These Francoists are a slab for the PP, which on the other hand is a necessary political party in Spain. It is true that in the 80s and 90s that Franco footprint brought them votes, but today it is obvious that with Citizens stepping on their heels, the Franco footprint all it does is hinder.

And all this theory has been proven these days.

Today is a memorable day in Spain, because what has happened in the last two weeks is a sample of **democratic health**: 1) the gürtel sentence was proof of the independence of the judiciary; 2) there are instruments to articulate the requirement of responsibility to the Government; 3) there is a political majority capable of sacrificing their own interests in favor of dignity and public interest.

With the motion of censure to Rajoy, Spain has shown to the nostalgic that the dictatorship ended long ago and that today the violation of the Law has consequences.

I have faith that the political purification will one day arrive in Spain, but there is no doubt that the íter will pass by condemning and recognizing that the military coup to the republican democracy was wrong, that the Franco dictatorship was disastrous for the Spanish People, and that covering nostalgic Francoists carries a political cost.

In any case, what we are going to stop seeing and hearing is a President of the Government saying phrases like this: "**I have lived many years next to the Marin Naval School, in Salvador Moreno Street. Now I do not know why they have taken the name from the street, I still call it that way**".

For those who still do not know who Salvador Moreno was, I bring this simple note taken from [Wikipedia](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Moreno_Fern%C3%A1ndez): "**the Massacre of the Málaga-Almería road perpetrated which consisted of the indiscriminate bombing of civilians who fled massively along the road from Malaga to Almeria, after the fall of Malaga at the hands of the rebel group, causing between 3,000 and 5,000 dead**".

Finally, as I said at the beginning, to congratulate the Spanish People for having political groups that at least reach the minimum necessary to do politics.
