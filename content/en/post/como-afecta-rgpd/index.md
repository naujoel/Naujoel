On May 25, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the EU entered into force and today there is still some confusion about what must be done for a website to comply with European regulations. In this post we try to put some light on the matter.

## 1. What is the GDPR?
Let's start from the beginning, GDPR means Regulation (EU) 2016/679 General Data Protection. As the name implies, it is related to the data of the users registered by the websites when they browse or use their services. The purpose of the GDPR is to improve the privacy of the data and also the way in which companies approach or plan this matter.

## 2. Will it affect my business?
Yes, whenever you register information that can uniquely identify an individual (for example: names, photos, email addresses or IP address) you must comply with the new standard. The only exceptions are anonymous forms, such as surveys or questionnaires that do not collect personal data.

This will affect both companies that are in the EU and those outside the EU that process personal information regarding EU citizens.

The new legislation entered into force on May 25, 2018.

## 3. What are the requirements of GDPR?
Explicit consent: users must give explicit consent for the website to collect their information. This consent cannot be masked in an extensive text of "Terms and conditions", it must be independent and very clear to the user.

Access to the information offered: users should be allowed to view the information collected from them on their site.

Allow option to delete information: users should be offered an easy way to withdraw their consent and remove information from their site.

## 4. Where to start?
The Spanish Agency for Data Protection has provided a free online tool called "Facilitates" help for companies in order to verify the risk of the processing of personal data they perform and therefore, compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation.

On the other hand, the user registry must have the checkbox "I have read and accept the conditions of this website" which must be un-selected by default.

## 5. Key points
### Citizens Rights
The GDPR reinforces existing rights, generates new rights and offers citizens greater control over their personal data. Are included:

* a **easier access to your data**, for example, by providing more information on how that data is treated and ensuring that the information is available in a clear and understandable way;
* a **new right to data portability** that facilitates the transmission of personal data between service providers;
* a **clearer right to suppression ("right to be forgotten")** when an individual does not want their data to be processed further. When there is no legitimate reason to keep them, the data will be deleted;
* **right to know when personal data has been hacked**: companies and organizations will have to quickly inform people about any serious infringement related to personal data. They must also inform the relevant supervisory authority regarding data protection.

### Business rules

The GDPR is designed to create business opportunities and to stimulate innovation through various steps, including:

* **a single set of rules applicable throughout the EU**: it is estimated that the existence of a single data protection law for the entire EU will save € 2.3 billion per year;
* the designation, by public authorities and companies that process large-scale data, of a **data protection delegate**;
* a **single window mechanism**: authorities must deal with a single supervisory authority (in the EU country where they have their headquarters);
* **EU standards for companies outside the EU**: companies based outside the EU must apply the same rules when offering products or services or monitoring the behavior of people within the EU;
* **standards that promote innovation**: a guarantee that safeguards regarding data protection are integrated into products and services from the early stages of development (data protection by design and default);
* **privacy-friendly techniques**, such as **pseudonymisation** (when the identification fields of a data record are replaced by one or more artificial identifiers) and **encryption** (when the data is encoded so that only authorized parties can read them);
* **elimination of notifications**: the new data protection rules eliminate most of the notification obligations and the costs associated with them. One of the objectives of the Data Protection Regulation is to eliminate obstacles to the free movement of personal data within the EU. This will facilitate the expansion of companies;
* **impact evaluations**: companies must carry out impact evaluations when data processing may cause a greater risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals;
* **record keeping**: SMEs are not obliged to keep records of their treatment activities, unless such activities are regular or likely to cause a risk to the rights and freedoms of the person whose data is being processed.
