Barcelona was the first city to emerge luminous from the Franco penumbra. Soon the rest of the Catalan cities and provinces followed it, until it became the first autonomous community in areas such as industry, economy, culture or tourism.

They were the times of Pujol, Maragall, Montilla, and even the first stage of Artur Mas. Catalonia thus became the **showcase of Spain**, that region through which the rest of the world knew and entered Spain.

As in all groups, in the group of autonomous communities there was a leader, a role that played Catalonia flawlessly and that the rest of Spain supported. A leader who also had a **disability of the "three per sent"**, which makes her even more worthy of her position.

With the maturity of the Rule of Law and Democracy, came the full exercises of the rights and freedoms that the Constitution protected (and protects). Among them was the **freedom of expression**, guaranteed by art. 20 Spanish Constitution (SC) and by the UDHR, and that consists in that freedom that we all have to open our mouths, emit a sound, move our tongues, and whatever comes out of our mouths, that they don't lock us up.

One day, someone did that with his mouth and the phrase "**Vulem la indapandansia perqua España ens roba**" came out. Someone who was there heard it and thought it sounded good, that it had rhythm, and began to hum it too, and in turn, someone also heard it and little by little the phrase became popular, that is, what we would say today that the phrase "**went viral**".

Catalans have many good things that characterize them, and one of the most significant is to be able to take advantage of the most unlikely ideas (eg Chupa Chups), hence they are pioneers in many areas. And how could it be less, those pioneers of the independence phenomenon discovered that dedicating themselves to repeating that phrase gave to live, moreover, it gave to live very well. And as if it were the **golden egg hen**, they put all their efforts into caring and pampering the chicken, above all. Today it is public and notorious that independence indoctrination rests on the idea that "**The end justifies the means**".

The illusion of people is something powerful, not in vain there is the quote "Faith moves mountains." And a good example of this can be seen in the independence phenomenon. By their faith, their fans are able to go outside to demonstrate on a rainy day, travel hundreds of kilometers, spend their money on badges, flags, bows, and any **merchandising** that the organization offers them, and finally, to repeat everything that the organization tells them to repeat, even if it is a lie (remember that "the end justifies the means").

It is legitimate to pretend a desire and manifest it publicly. It is also to create a structure with revenue streams that supports the idea. Even decorate it with a brand image that attracts new followers. But what does not fit in a rule of law is to transgress the legality, or lie, or use public administrations for partisan purposes, or spend everyone's money for the benefit of a few, or try to convince the rest of the world that success Catalonia is due only to the independence sector, or wanting to impose their ideas on the rest of the population through intimidation and coercion, or indoctrinate children by altering history, etc.

So, **what is the point of equilibrium of the political market in Catalonia?**

It is known that the ideal situation is one that reaches the equilibrium point that turns the political market of Catalonia into an efficient market. For this, the old CiU (today JuntsxCat) has to return to the moderate speech, ERC has to give prominence and be more careful that "the cake is not discovered", for this it should assume a more political role and abandon the anarchic discourse, dramatic and unilateral, and think a little more about how to improve life to the painful Catalan society, with the aim of returning Catalonia to the leadership position in Spain.

Now, the safest thing is that Puigdemont will again preside over the Generalitat and may have a second chance to leave a mark on history at the height of the presiding institution. If so, if you realize that once you hold the position, you must exercise it _erga omnes_ (for all), there will be a progressive return to normalcy. The 1-O showed that declaring independence in Spain is still somewhat crude, in addition, the independence business is based on repeating the phrase forever, if they became independent **would end** the business _what else?_

In any case, the new legislature must serve to correct the footprint left by the previous government and continue with claims of constitutional height to use the legal and legitimate means of constitutional reform, does this not seem much better than spending the presidency with A few tickets to Belgium constantly in your pocket?

If you have come here, you may be thinking that this has been written by a "façade", surely if you are a fan of the independence organization you have been thinking about it for a while. But this is not the case, it happens that this is written by a leftist jurist who also believes that Spain would work better with the form of the Republic State although at the same time he believes that Don Felipe de Borbón dignifiedly plays the role of Head of State and that At the moment we can deal with many more important things. At the same time I show myself in favor of constitutional reform based on a logical foundation: if the Constitution regulates a society, and society evolves, then the Constitution has to be updated to regulate the new society.
