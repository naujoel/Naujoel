The reconquest was a period between the eighth and fifteenth centuries when the Christians of Hispania (more specifically, of the Hispanic brand) were gradually recovering the territory occupied by Muslims.

That mission, sponsored by the kings and the Church under the principle "Go and settle" (the kings gained territory and the Church gained adherents), was characterized by the seizure, through expulsion and settlement, of the lands, cities and properties that the Muslims left behind.

To carry out the reconquest of Valencia, King Jaime I prepared an army with ** Aragonese and Catalan contingents ** that after the fight populated the reconquered territory.

A few years ago, around 1270 a language called Valencian was already spoken in Valencia, and **in that language King Jaime I wrote the Llibre dels feits** (it should be noted that [Wikipedia](https: // es. wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_I_de_Arag%C3%B3n) says it was written in Catalan and a few lines below says it was written in Valencian, in any case, if you wrote it / dictated in the last stage of your life and King Jaime I died in Alzira -Valencia- it is very likely that the original was in Valencian).

Thus the years passed and the locals kept the language alive until the contemporary age.

During the Franco dictatorship, **linguistic repression** implied the prohibition or ridicule of the languages ​​of Spain other than Spanish, the only politically recognized language. The native language and culture was systematically pursued, especially in the administration, in the media, in the school, in the university, in public signaling and in general in all public demonstrations. wealthy spoke Castilian and the poor spoke Valencian and when they tried to speak Spanish they noticed an accent that denoted their origin, which generated a greater **adherence to Spanish**.

However, a majority of **loyal children of the earth kept the tongue alive to this day**.

With the arrival of the Spanish Constitution and the Autonomies, in Valencia they rushed to proclaim their own identity. Soon, those who in the Franco era spoke Spanish and taught the subject of "Language" in Catholic schools, self-empowered themselves on the subject and created a **Qualifying Board of Coneiximents de Valenciá**, translated any book into Valencian, many wasps began to write books in Valencian almost on any subject, the public television Channel 9 was created that pretended to be in Valencian (today closed), etc.

However, the first alarm went off when the European Union asked all its members for a copy of the Treaty on European Union in each of its co-official languages ​​and the copies arrived in Brussels. When they opened the Catalan and Valencian copies they saw that they were identical, so they took only one copy and wrote "**Treaty of the European Union in the language that is called Catalan in Catalonia and in Valencia is called Valencian**".

From there, in Valencia they realized the disaster they had been doing with the tongue and tried to remedy it. Obviously, if the same people who had made the disaster were trying to fix it, they could not expect anything other than more nonsense and when they no longer knew where to leave they ended the "Solomonic decision" to say that **the Valencian does not exist** and that Catalan.

Today, the Valencian situation in Valencia is as follows:

1. In the schools **the children study Catalan**, the books they study are from Catalan publishers, the websites where they have to go for information are websites with .cat domain, etc.
2. Children have studied a subject called Valencian since they were 3 years old, which is actually Catalan and when they finish high school they still have to obtain the title of coneiximents of Valencia granted by the JQCV to be able to access a job of the Administration For this, they have to pay the fees (which cost € 25) and the JQCV is still able to suspend these children who have been passing that subject for 15 years. Strictly speaking, the JQCV gives them the elementary degree degree just for having studied but this title has no value since it can be obtained by almost anyone.
3. in the street **the Valencian is spoken** which is a language very similar to Catalan but is not exactly the same. In fact, if we put a Catalan and a Valencian to speak surely **they end up speaking Spanish**.
4. In the curriculum there is a subject called "Valencian" that is core and that does half for the selective. Children learn Catalan at school but speak at home in Valencian, which leads to a low grade and a low grade.
5. Valencian students **do not get high marks in the selective** and have to study either careers with lower grades or study in other communities.
6. Students from other communities that do not have the language as a core subject get better grades and **can access the careers with high marks** offered in Valencia.
7. The JQCV remains obstinate in justifying its existence by evaluating some "coneiximents of Valencia" that are actually "**coneiximents de catalá**" and forcing the people to speak a language they have never spoken.
8. The natives who present themselves to the tests to obtain the JQCV title they need to access a job of the Administration, suspend because **the language they speak does not match what is evaluated**.
9. The foreigners who come to the tests to obtain the title of coneiximents of Valencia do approve because **they have learned a new language** and do not make diction errors.
10. Those who have learned the language that the JQCV wants to impose **do not use it because nobody speaks that language in the street**.

And much more.

The **necessary reflection** is: Patés is a language spoken in the area of ​​Benasque (Huesca) that is also a Castilian-Franco-Catalan derivation and that, however, maintains its own identity, because that is what Try to maintain the cultural wealth of the people. And yet, the Valencian Community that covers much more territory than Benasque and that, by the Statute of Autonomy, had the opportunity to regulate its own identity, **by work and grace of the JQCV** and the entire battalion of writers and linguists who saw the opportunity to enrich themselves, **shattered what all Valencians had kept for centuries**.

In other words, if the individuals who regulated the language in Valencia had regulated the language in Galicia, **today in the Galician schools the Galician children would be learning Portuguese**.
