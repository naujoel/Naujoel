I had promised to be without speaking for a while, but my doctor prescribes that I should do so in cases of extreme need, since silence could lead to irreversible pathologies.

The case of the photomontage of the Christ of Bitterness is one of those cases in which the state of necessity forces me to speak.

## Assumption in fact

A day laborer picking the olive is discovering the virtues of computer science in his spare time, between wages and wages. One day he takes an image from the internet and does a photomontage test that looks beautiful and shares with his friends on social networks. The photomontage is about **the face of a man whom the Catholic religion calls Christ of Bitterness**. A devout Catholic sees the image and feels offended. He tells the kid to remove the image from social networks and as he does not, he files a criminal complaint. The criminal judge, when dealing with fundamental rights, admits knowledge of the substance of the matter. In the trial, the hegemonic party manages to convince the other party to accept their guilt in exchange for a substantial reduction of the fine. The day laborer of the olive harvest that saw a € 2,500 fine coming comes accepting his guilt and a € 450 fine. The judge, given that the defendant is pleading guilty, cannot do anything other than take the solution of the case for granted and thus resolves it.

This is, _so gross mode_, what has transcended.

The starting point should be that both the offense and freedom of expression are **susceptible to graduation**, and that the photomontage of the kid does not offend the same as a photomontage with the face of a horned demon. To find the degree we should observe the message conveyed by the photomontage, but it seems clear that the photomontage does not show an offensively clear message.

Then, by the principle of irrelevance of the _nomen iuris_, we should conclude that although the kid has agreed to say that he is guilty of having transmitted an offense through photomontage, that guilt should not be accepted, since the message is written (in the photomontage) that conveys and the seriousness of that message at all comes to transfer respect due to the beliefs of others.

In other words, let's imagine an assumption that two parties have been arguing on social media for some time and that among them the phrase "My grandmother bought tomatoes this morning" carries a subliminal message that only the other party understands and that the issuer has launched with the clear object of offending the receiver. The offender files a complaint and what will be the judge's response? With due caution, the principle of irrelevance of the nomen iuris should be applied, for things are what they are and not what the parties say they are. That is, the phrase is not offensive no matter how much the party says it is.

But this is not the most interesting perspective. There is more.

Spain is a secular State, which amounts to ‘non-denominational’ and includes the separation between State and Churches and the neutrality of the State in the face of beliefs and ideologies. The TC has had the opportunity to pronounce on it and points out that positive secularism is the formula by whose virtue secularity incorporates cooperation with confessions and is channeled into constitutional principles. It is clear, then, that the position of the powers of the State regarding religious beliefs must be neutral.

With this in mind, let's think now about the scope of the offenses. I would not let my son see a parishioner praying on his knees, sweaty, bleeding, with his eyes lost, ... because it is offensive. Nor would I let him see how a fervent cure of opus whips his back. I think we can agree that there are also examples of offenses in the other direction, that is, religions can also offend the People in a secular country if their presence invades the normal life of the people. That is, lashes, bleeding pilgrimages, and ultimately, all religious exaltations should be made in the privacy of a place of worship or in the personnel of each one, and therefore public exaltations should be prohibited.

So, my question is: why should the Spanish sovereign people tolerate public religious exaltations? OK, we accept the words "tradition", "folklore", and "tourism". Okay, but then if the Christ of bitterness goes out for a walk by tradition, folklore and tourism, **how is the offense justified**?

And now, let's take advantage of the fact that we are already in flour and analyze a final case to end. Imagine that in my street, I am the only atheist and the other neighbors are fervent believers who hang large crucifixes on their doors so that everyone knows how devoted they are. This situation oppresses me, stigmatizes me for not being one of them, I feel intimidated, coerced, ... My question is: who is violating the rights of others?
