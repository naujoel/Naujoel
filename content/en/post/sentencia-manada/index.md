There are still those who do not see crime in the acts committed by "La Manada", among them, without going any further, the magistrate "disagreeing with the majority criteria of the Chamber", and that is why I need to say something about it.

It is not about assessing the sentence or the Criminal Code, but only to show that what La Manada did is a crime and dispel doubts.

For this we are going to divide the facts into 6 parts:

1. A girl is chatting in a park bench with a group of people.
2. That girl leaves with 5 boys who were in the group of people.
3. The 6 people break into the portal of a foreign building.
4. An act of sexual content occurs in which there are 5 boys and a girl.
5. After the act of sexual content, the 5 boys leave leaving the girl alone and taking her cell phone.
6. The girl stays in a bank crying and is thus found by another person who accompanies her to file a complaint.

In the **first part** we will all agree that no one could say anything for or against. At that time, the 5 boys sure were supersympathetic and even trustworthy. Everything was laughter, and everything is going well.

In the **second part** it is not surprising that the girl believed that they were a good company to walk safely at night on the way home. On that journey, the boy group started conversations of a sexual nature, and the girl might even follow the game.

Let's stop here and reflect a bit. The girl would have done what she would have done and said what she would have said, until these moments of the events, it doesn't matter at all. Even if she was a brave girl (that there are today) that showed no fear and treated boys equally, is not justification for the act, nor is it giving implicit consent, or anything similar.

**Third part**, 6 people break into the portal of a foreign building. To begin with, the girl could be talking to the rest of the group and not even realizing that she had entered the portal of a building, especially if it's the many at night and you're coming home with a drink in the body . And it is even easier if someone has taken your wrist and drag you in.

**Fourth part**, an act of sexual content occurs. The magistrates affirm in the sentence, to appreciate passivity, overwhelm, restlessness, and submission in the girl. An attitude, in any case, that would not have a person who gives consent to the sexual act, but rather that of a person who acts under fear.

Let's stop again to reflect for a moment, is the attitude of a factory worker similar to that of the boss? Is the attitude of the prostitute similar to that of the lover or the wife? DO NOT.

We will know immediately who the worker is and who the boss is, and in the same way we will know who the prostitute and the lover or wife is, why? **By his attitude**, which follows from the fact of being or not obliged to do so.

I repeat the question again: is the girl's attitude that of a person who has given her explicit consent to perform that sexual act? DO NOT. There is no participation, no initiative, no active behavior, but overwhelm, restlessness, submission and passivity, according to the ruling. If the victim of the sexual assault opens his mouth or raises an arm, if the victim of a robbery delivers his bag to the robber, if the kidnapped person helps the kidnapper set the table to eat, they are all acting under fear and their positive acts should not be deduced consent.

**Fifth part**, the boys leave and take the girl's cell phone. None of the acts agree that the sexual act was consented, but quite the opposite. Precisely, leaving consciously taking the phone and leaving the girl alone, is the behavior of someone who knows that he has committed a crime.

And finally, the **sixth part** is a mere consequence of what happened. The person who has finished performing a consensual sexual act gets up, puts on his pants and goes home. If a person who has just performed a sexual act sits on a bench to cry and a stranger accompanies her to file the complaint, it certainly does not fit the behavior of a person who had given his consent regarding what happened to him. .

Regarding the penalty imposed, in my humble understanding the key to the case lies in not having considered La Manada as an **organized criminal group**, since it follows from the facts that his behavior responded to a plan: that of being nice , catch the young woman, corner her somewhere and have sex with her, with or without her consent (which means performing acts with intent). Hence, some of them remained vigilant in the search for an open portal and finding it guided the young woman to the interior.

## Addendum

It causes stupor that the victim of the sexual assault the discrepant magistrate ask the following question: **What statement did you make, facing them, so that they knew that you were in shock and that they were having that relationship situation? sexual without their consent, how could they; if you did something, said something, verbalized something?**

The first reason is that it seems to contradict itself, for **what can one expect a person who is in shock to say?** And even less that what could babble in shock could remember him today. But we can be even more astonished, it is not enough for the magistrate to ask the question, but he has also considered it in the sentence, that is, the question and the answer are taken into account to support his particular ruling.

And I say, **why, instead of that long question, he didn't simply ask you, did he tell you that he wanted to have sex with the five?** which is the same as asking him **did he give them his explicit consent?**, with this question the key to the matter is reached before, the question that they did not have the consent of the victim and therefore were not consensual sexual relations.

It also causes stupor to allude to psychological and medical reports to sow doubts about consent. In summary, both reports are inconclusive and are not sufficient to prove either the consent or lack thereof.
