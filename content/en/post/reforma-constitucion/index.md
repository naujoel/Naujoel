Recently, perhaps due to the current political situation, the issue of constitutional reform has been raised again, to which various personalities have expressed different opinions.

Among those that I have heard, they call my attention, on the one hand, those that demonstrate against the argument "... but tell me, what do we reform in the Spanish Constitution? Why is reform necessary? Why not? I find nothing to reform ... ", and on the other hand, the [posture of the "fathers of the Constitution"](https://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2018-01-11/padres-constitucion-pinchan -reforma-psoe-congreso-comision-territorial_1504389 /), which advocate in simpler ways, such as legislative modifications, speed up the margin provided by the EC itself, or interpret it.

My full adherence to the principle of continuous improvement forces me to say something about it.

However, suddenly, a question arises, among so much public, relevant, and even historical personality, can I say something?

Sovereign is the one who is not subject to another and art. 1 Spanish Constitution says that national sovereignty resides in the Spanish people, therefore, since I am part of the Spanish sovereign people and that I also have the fundamental right to freedom of expression, I should not violate anyone if I go up to the same stand and I say something.

The first question that requires an answer is why, **why should we reform the Spanish Constitution?**

There are two main reasons that justify the reform, first of all, the **context in which it was enacted** the Spanish Constitution was fundamentally political, supposed a radical change of state, the acting forces were political/executive, civil rights arrived by way of comparative law, and the shy social representation had to yield in favor of stability. And secondly, the **evolution** that the world, in general, and Spanish society, in particular, have experienced in these 40 years, and that by their transcendence infer the presumption that an exhaustive analysis, a setting point for the next 40 years, it is intuited necessary.

Therefore, the following question appears **What do we reform in the Spanish Constitution?**

This type of question only accepts a specific answer, however, it is not easy to reach the realization from such a wide and complex scope as "All the Right".

Therefore, it is necessary to apply the "Divide and conquer" principle.

From a first approach we could extract from "All the Right" those areas that have undergone major changes and a more pronounced evolution. It occurs to me for example that perhaps the Spanish Constitution could improve in aspects such as **immigration**, the new **technological era**, the **territorial organization** of the State, the function of the **Senate**, the **rigidity** of the Constitution, adherence to **international treaties** or relations with the **European Union**.

If we continue to apply the process we will arrive at the specific answer formulated in the heading.

The fact that the Spanish Constitution is a rigid constitution leads to its reform being delayed over time, and alternative solutions are adopted, however I think that 40 years is a more than reasonable period to stop and see if we can improve anything. In addition, the mere fact of appointing a Commission that concludes with a reform opinion that can be negotiated and approved will be a sign of democratic normality.

Obviously, this article is not intended to answer such complex questions, but only to make us reflect on the suitability of a hypothetical constitutional reform.

With the humble intention of having contributed my grain of sand, I say goodbye, placing you to contribute yours leaving your opinion.
