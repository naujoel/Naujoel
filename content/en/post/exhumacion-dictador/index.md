Echoing the "Judges for Democracy" communicate, which you can read in its entirety at [this address](http://www.juecesdemocracia.es/2019/06/05/comunicado-auto-del-tr Court-supremo -suspend-the-exhumation-the-remains-of-the-dictator /) and broadly:

1. The Administrative Litigation Chamber of the Supreme Court has cautiously suspended the Agreement of the Council of Ministers for the exhumation of the dictator.

2. The Chamber justifies the suspension in the damage that could be caused to the family by a hypothetical future invalidation of the Exhumation Agreement; **But what harm if those remains are on public soil in an improper way and what is being tried is to correct the anomalous situation?**

3. The Order grants the dictator the treatment of Head of State since October 1, 1936; Where have you searched for this information, in the dictator's particular encyclopedia or what?

4. Finally, from the Order, an overprotection of the dictator's memory and the interests of the dictator's family, against nature and in the absence of historical truth, follows.

## Why does this Auto generate embarrassment?

Legal ethics obliges the jurist to respect the internal professional ethical principles of the Spanish State, as well as those of the European Union and **disregard the truth** directly attentive to these principles.

However, an error would be understandable and would be in pure anecdote. However, it does not seem that the treatment granted to the dictator comes from an error but from something worse.

Everything seems to indicate that the introduction of the treatment of Head of State to the dictator has the **aggravating of captious**, as it tries to support an **inconsistent decision** in an **inaccurate data**.

During the time when **the Republic struggled to maintain democracy**, a "I don't know what" parallel, illegitimate and illegal one that issued "official bulletins" (illegality officers) parallel to the legitimate ones of the Republic was created, He issued stamps parallel to the legitimate ones of the Republic, ... and finally, he appointed Heads of State parallel to those of the Republic.

Obviously, if the facts were:

1. In 1931 Spain lived in democracy;

2. In 1936 the army attempted against Spanish democracy through a coup d'etat;

3. In 1936 the Spanish people struggle to maintain democracy

4. In 1939 the irresponsibility of the Spanish army had cost hundreds of thousands of lives (something that could have been avoided if the Law Degree were required to be general of the army).

There is no possibility for more "official bulletins" that are issued to wash history by whitewashing the dictator to the point of doing Head of State in full Spanish democracy. **Things are what it are and not what the Supreme Court wants them to be**.

In other words, the **coup player** will not cease to be so for more "official" (illegal) newsletters would have been issued, nor will he be blameless by the grace of an "official" (illegal) newsletter who **ordered the Bombing of Guernica**, nor will it suddenly turn out that it was a hero through an "official bulletin" (illegal) who **approved the massacre of the Malaga-Almeria road**, nor the one who **exiled to the exiles** Spaniards who fled to France and fell into Nazi hands or locked in the beach of Argelés-Sur-Mer (France), ..., or who caused a **socio-economic delay** to the Spanish nation to **develop an autarchy**, or who implanted a **national-Catholicism classist** that favored the sympathizers of the regime to the detriment of the vast majority that **lacked the basic welfare** enjoyed by the countries of our environment, etc., not one who stole the future from a Republic that had written its history by force of democratic elections icas, or who aligned us with the losing side in World War II. In short, **that man you speak to me about was what it was and not what you want it to be**.

Perhaps the Auto of Supreme Court is a trait that betrays the need for a process that decides what they were and were not the acts of the coup army. This process could begin by finding the anonymous bodies buried in the national territory, giving them dignified burial and resolving what was right and what was wrong at the time.

But if the above seems very complicated, they can simplify it by adding a new crime to the Criminal Code, the **offense of exaltation of the dictator**. This would compensate, at least in part, for the damage caused to the families of the victims of the coup army.

It does not seem that this new crime is nonsense, because if we look for the meaning of "terrorist" we find that it means "the one who practices the form of violent political struggle", that is, what the coup army did, "the **political struggle violent**". If we consider this analogy to be valid, the coup army of 1936 could already be considered a "**terrorist band**" and the exaltation of the dictator would be **the crime of exalting terrorism**.

If the analogy is still good, the fight between Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA), a group founded in 1958 who is credited with being the only one able to gather enough courage to face oppression, and the dictator, was in a fight between terrorists, turning the conflict **Dictator-ETA** into an armed conflict where two sides have conflicting opinions. Neither one nor the other should have greater reasons to be more or less worthy of their claims. However, today the exaltation of ETA is a crime and the exaltation of the dictator is not yet.

However, what has been said fails in that **the analogy in Criminal Law is not allowed**, the crimes must be classified in the Criminal Code to be convicted.

In any case, returning to the beginning, the Administrative Litigation Chamber of the Supreme Court has managed to cast a goal for the Spanish People's squad with the decision to suspend the exhumation of the dictator, however **the decision is inconsistent and generates shame among others the jurists**.
