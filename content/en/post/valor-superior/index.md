The Spanish people are the sovereign of Spain, this is nothing new but we will take it as a starting point for this article.

That national sovereignty resides in the Spanish People (art. 1.2 SC) means, among other things, that:

* Spain (whatever that is), is below, that is, subordinate to the will of the Spanish people.
* the Spanish flag is below.
* the anthem of Spain, is below.
* the King and the Crown are below.
* The Government and the Executive Power are below.
* The Judiciary is below.
* The Army and the State Security Forces are below.
* The Economy and Large Business Corporations are below.
* Politics and Political Parties are below.
* Journalism and Television are below.
* The rental price of homes is below.
* ...

However, art. 1.2 CE has the value of wet paper if there is no way to articulate its execution, its implementation, and this is the point where we will pay attention to this article.

Today, the Spanish people only have the referendum and election processes to decide on their future, but for some spell of the Holy Company, it is not harmed by referendum to the Spanish people with the necessary assiduity, nor the results of the electoral processes they seem to point to the will of the Spanish people, unless masochism is so widespread as to vote for a political party condemned for participating in a corrupt plot. I do not think so, so what kind of hypnosis can the Spanish people be suffering to not be able to point out their will?

Now there is no longer the excuse of fear of the return of Franco, the army generals themselves are capitalist men who need the economy to continue as it is, **for the sake of its own investment fund**; nor the ignorance of whatever Democracy may be that our past generations could host, because in 40 years of democracy there has been time to meet it for those who are still alive. In addition, there is no doubt about the maturity of Spanish democracy, it is worth noting, among other features, the independentistas, the animalistas, or the ultra-rightists, who are nothing more than signs of the maturity of the Spanish democracy that follows the same designs of the rest of democracies of its surroundings.

Thus, there is no choice but to assume that **we own our own destiny** (despite whoever weighs).

Now, what is that destiny? **What is the destiny of the Spanish people?**

Fate, whatever it may be, will be a fact, a reality, but until that day arrives, we should set some goals.

And what should those objectives be? **What should the Spanish people want?**

Unless the Holy Company's spell still lasts, the Spanish people should answer the following: "We want a better society."

And what is a better society? Well, simply, it is that society that **strives to improve** the aspects that are important for citizens.

It is obvious that it will be easy to make a list of the important aspects of citizens, but let's stop to observe the other part of the sentence: "it is a society that strives ...". This means that this society is on the move, is active, does things, ... In no way is it possible that whoever holds the sovereignty of something, is a mere spectator of that something, because at the practical level it has no value . In other words, if a dictator wrote in some fundamental law that sovereignty resides in the people and then there is no way to articulate it, on a practical level, that people would be suffering a dictatorship.

Therefore, we come to the key of the matter: **the Spanish Society has to do something** (whatever that something is).

That the Spanish Society is active, moves and does something, assumes that there must be certain guidelines that allow it to move in some direction, because if there are no such guidelines the forces are counteracted and the movement is void.

These guidelines are values, **the scale of company values​​**.

Let's put some examples. Journalism must report, there is no doubt about this; and gender violence is a problem, there is no doubt about this. But when the time comes to report a case of gender violence, the media has to decide between taking advantage of the power of attraction of the subject and recreating its dissemination to attract audience, or simply report the fact during the indispensable time.

It should not be good for a society to live in its day to day with so much gender violence, especially if it is the same cases over and over again in all the media for minutes and minutes, will the media not be taking advantage of informative of its power of attraction to generate audience? Do not you think that since the news media are recreated in informing us of cases of gender violence there has been an increase in these cases?

The Spanish Society could do something about it, of course, but the news media could do it, and best of all, if both had the same scale of values, the Society would inevitably head towards a better place.

We all have some obligation in this regard, **we cannot wait for others to come to solve our problems**. The Society has to do something. Some will explain it to their aunt, others will divulge it in their WhatsApp group, others will change the channel, or perhaps others will go out to demonstrate, but we must move.

Let's stop for a moment to introduce three cases (roughly) that we will use to assemble the puzzle:

1. The Watergate case led to the resignation of President Nixon Why? How? Basically, Nixon was denying his responsibility in the case while he could, a responsibility that was proven with some recordings made in the oval office and kept in the White House. Nixon refused to facilitate the recordings but the Republican senators themselves (Nixon party partners) forced the President to deliver the recordings. The same day he delivered the recordings, Nixon resigned.
2. In Switzerland, the People were asked if they would accept a lifetime pay in exchange for roboticizing all manufacturing processes. The Swiss people said no, that he preferred to continue working.
3. In France the "yellow vests" have managed to change many things imposed by the Macron Government.

These are only three examples, among many others, where society has moved in the same direction.

It is difficult to believe that Watergate would have succeeded in Spain, without mentioning the request for computers that the Prosecutor's Office made to the Popular Party and that it resulted in several missing computers and as many hard drives erased 35 times.

It is also difficult to believe that a lifetime pay deter Spanish picaresque.

And finally, I think we will all agree that we still have a long way to go to be able to achieve what the "yellow vests" have achieved in France.

Therefore, it is clear that something is wrong and that we have to do something to change it, but what? **What can we do?**

Watergate could not have succeeded if the United States senators had not had a homogeneous scale of values ​​in which "the public good", "the good of the Society", "the common good" had not occupied a higher level. Serve other more recent examples in which members of the American government resigned for not agreeing with Trump's ways. **Does it occur to anyone to think that a Spanish politician would resign because he disagreed with his President?** I have not seen him, nor do I think I see him in what is left of my life. But nevertheless we all know that this is the right direction, that politicians must be honest and prioritize higher values, even to the detriment of their own interests.

Thus, the Spanish Society must **force the fulfillment of its will**, penalizing who goes against it.

In this work, **Law students and jurists** have an ethical obligation to disclose the natural values ​​of any society, just as Greek philosophers did in ancient times. We have to train society, teach, and finally, educate in civic values ​​to the point that it seems impossible that others can apply. And this is what ultimately happens in the "better society" that we are all looking for. We must move towards a more intelligent, more formed society, capable of discerning the good from the bad, the superior value of the inferior value, the general good of the particular good, and capable, in turn, of choosing the right.

**Would we be able to find a Spaniard today who preferably applies the general good to the detriment of his own particular good?** I am not sure, but I think it would be difficult to find it.

However, there are societies where **applying the general good is the default way of living and living together**, so it is not something impossible to achieve.

Let's give another example of active Society: we are in the election year, there will soon be elections and we can express our will. But, **are we prepared to cast a smart vote?** How has our vote been in the last elections? Has it been based on facts based on conjecture only? Have we been guided by appearances, perhaps by appearance? physical, by political discourse?

**Let's examine what politicians did** with our vote during the last legislature.

My city changed political color in the last elections, today governs "Compromís". The little I know of the previous government is that the mayor led the processions with black mantilla and little else. The current government, among other things, created a Facebook page and a mobile app, providing citizens with an agile way of communicating suggestions and incidents. The result has been very positive, since the town hall operators can go straight to the problem. I give you several examples: 1) I know cases in which it was reported that a streetlight bulb had blown and the next day had been solved; 2) this year the rains were abundant and violent, breaking roads, this was communicated to the town hall and the next day the roads were again enabled; 3) My city has a problem with dog poops, since some dog owners are untouched, while neither seems to be the solution of distributing fines with the checkbook under the arm, the town hall found the provisional solution of sending cleaners when Receive notices about it.

In this case, my vote in the next elections will be a **vote based on the facts**, a justified and intelligent vote. Well, we must all do the same, we must check what those who govern us do and disseminate it, and in these matters we must apply the criterion of the general good. At the local or regional level, what else gives the color of the one that governs, what matters is that good faith and actions be demonstrated for the common good. We must not be so simple as to get carried away by the comfort of the traditional, that is why we have always believed, we must go and check it, and if it is not as we thought, then change our criteria. Let's annoy the town halls, let's ask, make requests, **give ideas and suggestions** to see what they do, and if they remain motionless, punish them with our vote, and in the meantime, **don't forget to spread it**.
