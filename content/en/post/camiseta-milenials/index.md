Of all the millennials in the world, those who know the least about Franco's dictatorship are just the Spanish millennials. This is because in the Spanish education system the rule of obviating the chapter dedicated to the dictatorship of Franco governs. It's true, check it out!

Ask your son, your nephew, your neighbor, or anyone under 20 years of age about the education he received regarding Franco's dictatorship and you will find that his answer is: _"there was a chapter on Franco's dictatorship but we skipped it and didn't study it"_.

And the thing worsens if we ask about **the last democratic period before the current one**, that is to say the republican period. A good example is the controversy raised over **if the shirt of the Spanish soccer team remembers the Republic flag**.

In Spain, erroneously, the Republic is associated with socialism, on the left, with something that is against the right, ... and is not true. A republic is only a form of State that is characterized by the figure of the Head of State as a person elected by the People, while in the monarchy it is held by a monarch. The state form is above the political currents, that is, it can be from the right or from the left in a monarchy or in a republic. In fact, in the US they are called "Republicans" precisely to conservatives (which would be equivalent here to "the right").

This is something serious that the elders must watch and repair, so that we have the obligation to transmit, at least, the inescapable basic truth.

In the first place it should be made clear that the Spanish people were never sovereign and that they always aspired to be. And that after many ups and downs throughout history he got it in 1931, when a democratic system was granted in the form of a Republic.

In order to assess this event, it must be taken into account that other States had achieved the same 200 years before. In other words, the Spanish people had been watching the achievements of others for 200 years while he had to remain oppressed.

It is not surprising that in 1931, when he succeeded, he began as when the bull enters the square, lashing out with everything.

Also tell the millennial, that the Spanish sovereign People of the Republic sure did some wrong things (such as the expulsion of the Jesuits, on the other hand justified because he was fed up with the confessional state) but that **the time, the Democracy and justice would have put everyone in their place** if they had the opportunity.

That opportunity to demonstrate the capacity of the Spanish People in a democratic system was taken 5 years later by a military coup that initiated a civil war that eventually introduced a dictatorship in 1939.

In short, what I come to say is that the millennials of today are the Spanish People of tomorrow, and that if they look for the answer to questions of the type **why in Germany and Italy is the offense of their dictatorships and in Spain no?**, be able to conclude, by themselves, that here the dictator died of old age and had time to prepare a transition to his liking that could make a democracy as they shared their interests and went to stay alive

Or of the type **why Franco did not participate in World War II?** Know that the conversation in Hendaye was something like:

- Hitler: _"Well Paco, what are you going to do? Do you join or do not join?"_

- Franco: _"I join, I join, but Spain is in ruins, I can only attack with stones"_

- Hitler: _"Okay, stay there and I'll call you"._

Or of the type **why corruption is allowed in Spain and you can hear phrases like: _"Ok, Cifuentes lied and has no Master but I do not see any problem in it"_?** I can conclude that in Spain in the transition a custom suit was made, that is, in Spain there was a hierarchical Francoist structure that did not disappear when Franco died, overnight, and still today, 40 years later, his vestige can be seen . If today, that we all have at least a few minimum studies, we are informed and we live in a social and democratic State of Law, we see how the [list of cases of corruption (more than 60)](https://www.eldiario.es/politica/corrupcion-Irene-Montero-afeado-PP_0_654084870.html) does not stop increasing, **What did not have to endure the society of 50 years ago that had no studies, the information was biased by censorship and lived in a dictatorship?**

Therefore, **that the shirt of the Spanish team remember the Republic of 1931 should take pride** for what our great grandparents were able to achieve.
