Hi Juanjo,

chance happened that last Sunday we met, at the door of the warehouse, Carlos and us, when María Jesús and I returned from walking.

That warehouse only brings back bad memories. Memories of the times they robbed us, of finishing the night working with wet clothes in winter, of working in the dark because there was no light, of carrying bags of sosa on the terrace, of hammering in my hand when I pressed the hoops of the barrels, of the hundreds of "cuarterolas" (weighing 250 kg) that over the years I had to move from one place to another with a cart pushed by brute force that when I had the wheels deflated required double effort, etc.

The worst thing is that this warehouse was the main source of all the discussions in the family, since I have the use of reason, since being located in a rustic area, it did not enjoy public services (water, sewage, electricity, mail, public lighting, etc). On the one hand, I was in favor of selling that warehouse and buying another (or making another one) in a suitable place (ex. an industrial place). And the opposite opinion was the Dad, who preferred to leave things as they were. In the middle were our sisters and Mom, who agreed with me but nevertheless preferred not to mediate or promote those actions that the company needed.

When Dad bought the land to build the warehouse, he was hesitating between two plots, one is where the warehouse is located today and the other is where the local police are currently located. He finally settled on the less fortunate, claiming he wanted to be calm. A regrettable but understandable decision, because when we sulfurized the peppers in the house on San Pedro street, the smell reached several streets around.

I remember some seriously reprehensible things from back then. On the one hand, it was decisive that Dad did not accept his mistake to losing the industrial train, since the 80s were the first post-dictatorship years and all the industries were modernizing, something that we could not do. On the other, the justification that Mom gave, both to Dad and to me, was that there was no money to make changes, which was totally false, as it was shown when Dad died, because one of the things that the lawyer said to do with black money was to build the two floors that are currently on Maestro Giner Street. And on the other, that during the 9 years I was working "side by side" with Dad, I did not receive a single month of payroll, due to a prehistoric vision of reality that affected my knowledge of life to such an extent of the discussions that Dad and I had regularly, I ended up going to work for Uncle Salvador, and naive of me, I got to work up to 14 hours a day charging only 8, because I did not know that the workers had to fulfill only 8 Obviously when I discovered it, my concept of Uncle Salvador became that of an exploiter.

In the talk that we had last Sunday with Carlos we were able to verify that you have a totally false conception about Virginia and the terrain of Cullera, and you must know the truth, the only one that exists, which can be demonstrated with evidence or witnesses.

I have always trusted that my relatives would be smart enough not to give credit to Virginia's version without having heard mine before, however, the talk I had with Carlos confirmed that this is not the case.

Virginia suffered a depressive adolescence, she was always jealous of her sister Rosa because when she was younger, she had found a happy and talkative boyfriend, while the former was obsessed with finding one as soon as possible. To make matters worse, when he found Vicente, he was not accepted by our parents, since he had a reputation as a junkie, which plunged Virginia even more into her depression. However, despite everything, I loved her the same and advised our parents that they should give the couple a chance.

When Dad died there was a lot of bustle about the business and the black money. I remember that we went to the Valencia lawyer, whose name I cannot remember, and there sitting in front of him they told me: "From now on you will take the business and you will be responsible." At only 21 years old, they did not ask me if I wanted to run the business, if it was the job I wanted to carry out for the rest of my life, but they made me directly responsible for a business that was pathologically condemned to death.

Well, in 1989 when I took over the business, the companies in the sector already had a great advantage in terms of industrialization, so I had to hurry to update the business.

One of the things I did in the 90s was founding a Limited Partnership with Virginia. She had a symbolic stake (which I gave her) and handled the business paperwork. Virginia had studied FP but was never skillful with the papers or anything, it could be said that she had an innate awkwardness in addition to a perpetual depression, so a couple of months later she left, made an excuse and left me. He chored me, because again I had to find someone to deal with the paperwork, but I have always been tolerant and understanding, and I knew that it was not pleasant to work in a humid, cold and rough environment, so I did not have it in mind and my esteem towards her remained perennial.

Already in the first decade of the new 21st century, when the time of the stormy business was happily behind, Virginia and Vicente showed up at my house. They had a piece of land in Cullera half with another person who was giving them problems, and they wanted me to replace the third in their position, after paying the amounts contributed to him, plus compensation.

María Jesús and I trust them, we fulfill what was agreed, and we replace the third in their position. However, from the moment Virginia got rid of her problem we began to see changes in her behavior.

The first thing she told us is that since the electricity connection had been paid by her, I had to pay her half, which I was willing to do as soon as I put the electricity on my plot. Despite the fact that nothing had been said in the negotiations prior to the signing of the contract, it seemed fair to pay half the cost when it was time to install a caravan on my plot. But she did not manage this issue well and the depressive Virginia that she knew from yesteryear reappeared. I do not know why she was in such a hurry to pay her half the electrical connection, because neither they were financially needy, nor was it spoken in the previous negotiations, nor was it written anywhere, and what is normal, in a few months, it could have come true, it started to seem increasingly difficult.

The next thing that happened was that, naturally, we as owners wanted to know how far our plot extended, so we told them that a map had to be made to define our plot in order to be able to locate our caravan in the most appropriate, to which they replied that we would do so later.

The next thing your sister Virginia did was install a side fence along her parcel without having yet delimited the parcels of each and leaving a very narrow path to enter my parcel without consulting my opinion.

Months passed and then years passed and they always had some excuse not to do the plan, until one day María Jesús and I made some very prudent calculations, since we wanted to plant some palm trees that some friends from Gandía had given us. I remember that when we returned from Gandía we went directly to the Cullera land to plant the palm trees and we finished at night. That day Virginia and Vicente were not there, so according to our prudent calculations we planted those palm trees where it was certain that our plot was. Then something unheard of happened, Virginia and Vicente appeared at night about 5 meters from us, without having seen them arrive, in the middle of our plot, shouting and rebuking that those palm trees could not be put in that place. The situation was chaotic, in the middle of the night, talking without being able to see each other's faces, arguing about a subject without any significance. Now I stop to think about that fact and I realize that in order for them to appear suddenly, they had to have the help of a neighbor to warn them, and to get that help, Virginia and Vicente would have had to ask for it, and when requesting the help should have been justified in some way, and knowing Virginia and Vicente I am convinced that the justification would be perverse.

One of the symptoms demonstrating Virginia and Vicente's baseness is their inelegant annoyance, unable to keep their shapes, they scream and insult insanely with insults that should only be known to tavern drunkards.

After all these events, having forgiven her so many times and running in her favor before our parents, my patience ran out and I decided not to have anything to do with Virginia for the rest of my life.

So I decided to sell my part of the land. The first thing I did was go to the Cullera City Council to inform me about the urbanization plans and the Property Registry to find out the registration status of the land. And what was my surprise when I discovered that the cadastral reference in the contract did not correspond to the land we were occupying, but to non-existent land that had been swallowed up by the sea. I also discovered that development plans had been stalled for a long time and things were not expected to change in a short time. And last but not least, I also discovered that the land was part of a disputed heritage whose solution loomed far away.

Stunned by feeling like a victim of a deception, I went to the seller to ask for explanations, to which she replied that Virginia and Vicente already knew all that when they bought the land and thus gave their consent in the sale.

Desolate to discover the fraud orchestrated by my own sister, I just wanted to die.

Still, I kept looking for a buyer for my part in the lot until I succeeded. It was Vicente Pallarés, cousin of the dentist Antonio Pallarés. It was the time of the real estate bubble and Pallarés was going to pay me double what it had cost me. Pallarés went to speak to Virginia to communicate her right to trial and retraction, and since she agreed to the sale, Pallarés told me to speak to his attorney to arrange the paperwork.

Pallarés' lawyer told me that he was going to prepare a sale contract, to which I replied that I preferred that I be substituted in my position in the original contract. The lawyer replied that either a new sales contract was made or nothing would be done, to which I replied that I was going to think about it.

Back then I believed that making a false sale (because the contract reference did not correspond to the occupied land) could have serious consequences, so I let time go looking for another buyer and things got cold.

We no longer enjoyed the land and we never went there, we just wanted to sell our part but we couldn't find anyone.

One of the times we went to visit Mom, she began to probe us about the possibility that Virginia would keep my part. Mom knew that I was desperate to sell my part of the land, so she was stealthily inducing me on the advisability of selling my part to Virginia. They were so miserable that they only offered us the amount that we had paid, with no added compensation. Considering that a year before they gave me double and I couldn't sell it because of the scam plotted by Virginia and Vicente, and verifying that your own mother is conspiring against you, made you want to cry. But what could I do, I couldn't find any way out, I wanted to forget about so many problems and turn the page, so they finally convinced me and I sold my share for the same cost, after years of suffering, without any compensation in return.

And these are the reasons why I have not spoken to either Virginia or Vicente, nor will I for the rest of my life.

A hug.
