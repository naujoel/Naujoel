# Welcome to Minneapolis

[Drupal](https://drupal.org/) | [DrupalCon Minneapolis 2020](https://events.drupal.org/minneapolis2020)

## Features

- In Minneapolis, you're never more than six blocks from a park, and chances are you'll see a few lakes as well.
- Minneapolis is home to a thriving culture of food, music, and the great outdoors.
- From the Stone Arch Bridge to Minnehaha Falls, from Northeast Arts District to Eat Street, there's a gem of a city to be discovered.
- Discovery is part of DrupalCon, so plan to join us in Minneapolis.

## Code Highlighting

Inline code: `variable`

Code block:
```python
porridge = "blueberry"
if porridge == "blueberry":
    print("Eating...")
```

---

## Math

In-line math: $x + y = z$

Block math:

$$
f\left( x \right) = \;\frac{{2\left( {x + 4} \right)\left( {x - 4} \right)}}{{\left( {x + 4} \right)\left( {x + 1} \right)}}
$$

## Fragments

Make content appear incrementally

```
{{%/* fragment */%}} One {{%/* /fragment */%}}
{{%/* fragment */%}} **Two** {{%/* /fragment */%}}
{{%/* fragment */%}} Three {{%/* /fragment */%}}
```

Press `Space` to play!

{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}}
{{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}}
{{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}

---

A fragment can accept two optional parameters:

- `class`: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS)
- `weight`: sets the order in which a fragment appears
